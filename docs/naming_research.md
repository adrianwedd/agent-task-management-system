# Naming Research for Task Management System

## Brainstorming Ideas

- **TaskFlow**: Simple, implies movement and process.
- **AgentDesk**: Highlights agent-centric nature.
- **WorkForge**: Emphasizes creation and robust work.
- **GeminiTasks**: (If related to Gemini platform)

## Availability Check (Preliminary)

- **TaskFlow**:
    - Domain: taskflow.com (taken), taskflow.dev (available)
    - PyPI: taskflow (taken)
    - npm: taskflow (taken)

- **WorkForge**:
    - Domain: workforge.com (taken), workforge.dev (available)
    - PyPI: workforge (available)
    - npm: workforge (available)

## Recommendation

**WorkForge** seems promising due to its availability across PyPI and npm, and a relevant `.dev` domain. It conveys a sense of creation and robust work, aligning with the system's purpose.
