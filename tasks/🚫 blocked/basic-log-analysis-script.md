## Description

Develop a simple Python script to parse application logs (e.g., `logs/agent_tasks.log`)
for common patterns, errors, and warnings. This script will provide basic insights
into system behavior and help in initial debugging efforts.


## Notes

The script should be runnable from the command line and output a summary of findings.
It can use simple string matching or regular expressions to identify patterns.

[Manual Block] Validation system identified unresolved dependencies that auto-fix missed.
