## Description

Develop a configurable dictionary or mapping of agent capabilities to keywords
or task types. This will allow the validation system to more accurately assess
if a task's content matches the assigned agent's capabilities, reducing
'agent: Task content may not match agent capabilities' info messages.


## Notes

This dictionary should be easily updatable without code changes (e.g., a YAML file).
It will serve as a central source of truth for agent specializations.
