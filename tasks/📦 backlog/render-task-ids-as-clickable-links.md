## Description

Modify the CLI to render task IDs as clickable links, allowing users to easily
open the corresponding task Markdown files in their IDEs directly from the terminal.
This will significantly improve the user experience for navigating and editing tasks.


## Notes

The links should ideally be configurable to support different IDEs (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ)
and operating systems. A good default might be a `file://` URL or a custom scheme like `vscode://`.
