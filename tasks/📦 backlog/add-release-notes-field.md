title: Add Release Notes Field to Task Schema
description: Extend the task data model to include a release_notes field that allows
  tasks to specify their user-facing impact and changelog entry. This field will be
  used by automated changelog generation to create meaningful release notes that communicate
  changes from a user perspective rather than just technical implementation details.
