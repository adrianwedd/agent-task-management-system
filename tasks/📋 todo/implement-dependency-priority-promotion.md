title: Implement Dependency Priority Promotion Logic
description: 'Add intelligent logic to automatically increase priority and move tasks
  from backlog to todo when they become critical dependencies for other tasks. The
  system should identify tasks that: 1) Are currently in backlog with low/medium priority,
  2) Have no unmet dependencies themselves, 3) Are blocking other higher-priority
  tasks. These dependency-critical tasks should be automatically promoted in priority
  and moved to todo status to unblock downstream work.'
