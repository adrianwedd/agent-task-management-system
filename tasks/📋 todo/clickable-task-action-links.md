title: Add Clickable Action Links to CLI Task List
description: 'Enhance the CLI''s task listing to include clickable links that, when
  activated,

  execute predefined actions for each task (e.g., ''start'', ''complete'', ''add note'').

  This will streamline task management directly from the terminal output.

## Task Description

Modify the CLI's `list` command output to include clickable elements next to each task. These elements, when clicked in a compatible terminal, should execute a specific CLI command related to that task (e.g., `python -m src.task_management.cli status <task_id> in_progress`).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The `python -m src.task_management.cli list` output includes clickable action links for each task.
- [ ] At least two common actions (e.g., 'start task', 'complete task') are available as clickable links.
- [ ] Clicking an action link executes the corresponding CLI command for that task.
- [ ] The generated commands are safe and do not require manual editing by the user.
- [ ] The feature is robust across different terminal emulators that support clickable links.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Identify Target Actions**: Determine which task actions are most useful to expose as clickable links (e.g., `status in_progress`, `status complete`, `add-note`).
2.  **Generate Shell Commands**: For each task in the list, construct the full shell command for the desired action, including the task ID.
3.  **Format as Clickable Links**: Use appropriate terminal escape codes or libraries to embed these shell commands as clickable links within the CLI output.
4.  **Integrate with `list` command**: Modify the `list_tasks` function in `src/task_management/cli.py` to include these clickable links in its output.
5.  **Test**: Verify that clicking the links executes the commands as expected.

## Notes

-   Consider how to handle actions that require user input (e.g., `add-note` might need a prompt for the note content).
-   The `click` library might offer utilities for creating interactive CLI elements.
