title: Implement Automated Code Review Triggering
description: |
  Develop a system to automatically trigger code reviews by agents (e.g., Claude)
  based on predefined events (e.g., pull request creation, specific labels).
  This will leverage the task management system's API to create review tasks
  and assign them to appropriate agents.

  This task will involve setting up GitHub webhooks or similar mechanisms to listen
  for events, and then using the task management API to create and manage review tasks.
  Consider how to pass relevant context (PR URL, commit SHA) to the review agent.

## Task Description

Implement an automated system that triggers code review tasks for agents. This system will monitor GitHub events (e.g., new pull requests, label additions) and, based on configurable rules, create new review tasks within the task management system via its API. These tasks will then be assigned to appropriate review agents.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new GitHub Actions workflow (or similar) is created to listen for relevant events.
- [ ] The workflow can call the task management system's API to create a new task.
- [ ] The created task includes relevant information about the code to be reviewed (e.g., PR link, branch name).
- [ ] The task is assigned to a designated code review agent (e.g., Claude, or a generic REVIEWER agent).
- [ ] The system can be configured to trigger reviews based on different criteria (e.g., all PRs, PRs with specific labels).
- [ ] No sensitive information is exposed during the process.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Design Event-to-Task Mapping**: Determine which GitHub events trigger which types of review tasks.
2.  **Develop GitHub Action**: Create a GitHub Action that uses webhooks or polling to detect events.
3.  **Call Task Management API**: Use the `implement-api-task-triggering` functionality to create tasks.
4.  **Pass Context**: Ensure relevant PR/code context is passed to the new task's description or notes.
5.  **Assign Review Agent**: Assign the task to a suitable review agent.
6.  **Test**: Create dummy PRs and verify that review tasks are created correctly.

## Dependencies

-   `implement-api-task-triggering`: Essential for programmatic task creation.
-   `integrate-claude-code-base-action`: If Claude is to be the review agent, this integration is necessary.
