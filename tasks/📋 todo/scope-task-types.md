title: Scope Introduction of Task Types
description: |
  Define and scope the introduction of different task types (e.g., Bug, Feature, Chore,
  Documentation) into the task management system. This task will involve identifying
  the necessary changes to the task data model, CLI, and validation rules to support
  task categorization and potentially different workflows or attributes per type.

## Task Description

This task focuses on defining the scope and requirements for introducing task types into the system. It's a research and design task, not an implementation task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A clear definition of proposed task types (e.g., Bug, Feature, Chore, Documentation, Research).
- [ ] Identification of new fields or attributes required for each task type (if any).
- [ ] Proposal for how task types will influence existing functionalities (e.g., validation rules, analytics, reporting).
- [ ] Outline of necessary CLI changes to support task type creation, filtering, and display.
- [ ] Consideration of how task types might affect future features (e.g., workflow automation).
- [ ] A brief analysis of the impact on the current data model and migration strategy (if needed).

## Implementation Steps (for this scoping task)

1.  **Research Common Task Type Models**: Look at how other task management systems categorize tasks.
2.  **Propose Task Type Enumeration**: Define a set of initial task types relevant to this project.
3.  **Identify Type-Specific Attributes**: Determine if certain task types require unique fields (e.g., a 'bug_severity' for Bug tasks).
4.  **Analyze Impact on Existing Modules**: Consider how `task_manager.py`, `task_validator.py`, `task_analytics.py`, and `cli.py` would need to change.
5.  **Document Proposal**: Write a detailed proposal in a new Markdown file (e.g., `docs/task-types-proposal.md`) outlining the findings and recommendations.

## Notes

-   The goal is to define *what* needs to be done, not to *do* it.
-   Keep the initial set of task types simple and expandable.
