## Problem Analysis

**Agent Name Creep Detected:**
- CODEFORGE (9 instances) - too specific
- TESTCRAFTERPRO - proprietary naming
- NARRATIVE_WARDEN - project-specific
- References to 28+ specialized agents from other repositories

**Issues:**
1. Portfolio shows proprietary/internal agent names
2. Inconsistent naming conventions
3. No clear agent role taxonomy
4. Potential IP concerns with specific agent names

## Proposed Generic Agent Strategy

### Standard Agent Roles (Generic Names):
```yaml
# Development Agents
- DEVELOPER      # Code implementation and features
- QA_ENGINEER    # Testing and quality assurance  
- TECH_WRITER    # Documentation and technical writing
- ARCHITECT      # System design and architecture

# Operations Agents  
- DEVOPS         # CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure
- SECURITY       # Security analysis and compliance
- ANALYST        # Data analysis and reporting
- PROJECT_MGR    # Project coordination and planning

# Specialized Agents
- RESEARCHER     # Investigation and analysis
- INTEGRATOR     # System integration and APIs
- OPTIMIZER      # Performance and optimization
- VALIDATOR      # Validation and verification
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Agent Name Mapping
- [ ] Audit all current agent references
- [ ] Create mapping from specific â†’ generic names
- [ ] Define agent role responsibilities
- [ ] Update agent templates and documentation

### Phase 2: Data Migration
- [ ] Update all existing task files with new agent names
- [ ] Migrate agent-specific templates
- [ ] Update documentation and examples
- [ ] Verify system functionality

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Ensure no proprietary names remain
- [ ] Test all CLI functionality
- [ ] Validate analytics and reporting
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new agent strategy

## Agent Role Definitions

### DEVELOPER
- Code implementation
- Feature development
- Bug fixes and maintenance
- Code reviews

### QA_ENGINEER  
- Test planning and execution
- Quality assurance processes
- Test automation
- Performance testing

### TECH_WRITER
- Documentation creation
- API documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Technical specifications

### ARCHITECT
- System design
- Technology decisions
- Integration patterns
- Scalability planning

## Files to Update

1. All task files in `/tasks/` directories
2. Template definitions in `task_templates.py`
3. Documentation references
4. Example configurations
5. CLI help text and examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No proprietary agent names in codebase
- [ ] Consistent generic naming convention
- [ ] Clear agent role definitions
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Portfolio-appropriate agent taxonomy
- [ ] Updated documentation reflects new naming
