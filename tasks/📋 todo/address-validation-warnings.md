## Description

Review and resolve the remaining warnings and info messages from the task validation report.
This includes ensuring tasks with dependencies are not in TODO status, adding due dates to critical tasks,
balancing agent workloads, and refining agent assignments based on task content.


## Notes

Current validation report shows:
- Tasks with unresolved dependencies in TODO status.
- Critical priority tasks missing due dates.
- CODEFORGE agent has a high workload.
- Some tasks' content may not match their assigned agent's capabilities.
- The DEVELOPER agent has no active tasks.


[2025-07-24T09:17:51.334548] Struggles and Progress Summary:

  My primary struggle stemmed from misusing the replace tool, particularly with multi-line strings and when the target file was already in a corrupted state. I learned that:

   *  requires an exact  match: Even minor discrepancies in whitespace or line endings will cause it to fail.
   * Iterative  on corrupted files is disastrous: Attempting to fix syntax errors by repeatedly using replace on a file that's already malformed leads to file bloat and further
     corruption, as demonstrated by task_validator.py growing to 6000 lines.
   *  is critical: When a file becomes corrupted, the safest and most efficient approach is to immediately revert it to its last known good state using git restore 
     <file_path>.
   *  for complex changes: For significant modifications or when replace proves too finicky, write_file with the complete, correct content of the file is a more reliable
     method.

  Solution for Current Task ( and ):

  The core problem with the _validate_agent_workload method in TaskValidator was that it was operating on a stale copy of the task data. The tasks dictionary passed to
  validate_task_system (and subsequently to _validate_agent_workload) was a snapshot from when load_all_tasks was last called. Agent reassignments were updating the live
  task_manager.tasks_cache, but _validate_agent_workload wasn't seeing these changes.

  The solution involves:
   1. Passing  to : The TaskValidator instance in TaskCLI will now receive self.task_manager in its constructor.
   2. Storing  in : The TaskValidator class will store this task_manager instance.
   3. Directly accessing : The _validate_agent_workload method (and other system-wide validation methods) will directly access self.task_manager.tasks_cache
      to ensure they always operate on the most up-to-date data.

  Plan:

   1. Revert : (Confirmed as done in the previous turn).
   2. Modify : Pass self.task_manager to TaskValidator.
   3. Modify : Accept task_manager and store it.
   4. Modify : Change tasks.values() to self.task_manager.tasks_cache.values() and tasks.keys() to self.task_manager.tasks_cache.keys() where
      appropriate.      5 - 8 are yours
