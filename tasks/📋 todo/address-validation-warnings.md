title: Address Remaining Task Validation Warnings and Info Messages

  dates to critical tasks,

  balancing agent workloads, and refining agent assignments based on task content.

## Task Description

This task aims to systematically go through the current task validation report and address all remaining warnings and informational messages. The goal is to improve the overall data quality and consistency of the task management system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All "status: Tasks with unresolved dependencies should be BLOCKED or PENDING, not TODO" warnings resolved.
- [ ] All "due_date: Critical priority tasks should have a due date" warnings resolved.
- [ ] CODEFORGE agent workload is balanced (warning removed).
- [ ] All "agent: Task content may not match agent capabilities" info messages addressed (either by changing agent or task content).
- [ ] "agent: Agents with no active tasks: DEVELOPER" info message addressed (either by assigning tasks or removing agent if no longer needed).
- [ ] Validation report shows no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or INFOs related to these categories.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Review Validation Report**: Go through each warning and info message.
2.  **Adjust Task Statuses**: For tasks with unresolved dependencies, change their status to BLOCKED or PENDING.
3.  **Add Due Dates**: For critical priority tasks without due dates, add a reasonable due date.
4.  **Reassign Agents**: For tasks where agent capabilities don't match content, reassign to a more appropriate agent or adjust task content.
5.  **Balance Workload**: If CODEFORGE is still overloaded, reassign some tasks to other agents.
6.  **Address DEVELOPER Agent**: Assign new tasks to DEVELOPER or consider removing it if it's truly inactive.
7.  **Re-validate**: Run `python -m src.task_management.cli validate` after each batch of changes to track progress.
