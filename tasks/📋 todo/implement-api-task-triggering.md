title: Implement API for External Task Triggering
description: 'Implement a robust API for the task management system to allow external
  applications

  (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, other agents) to programmatically trigger and manage tasks.

  This includes defining API endpoints, implementing secure authentication/authorization

  (e.g., API keys, OAuth), enabling task creation/updates by ID or template, and handling

  parameter passing for task details.

## Task Description

Develop a set of API endpoints that expose core task management functionalities to external systems. This will allow for programmatic control over tasks, enabling advanced automation scenarios.

## Key Features to Implement:

1.  **API Endpoints**: Define clear and consistent RESTful (or similar) endpoints for:
    -   Creating new tasks (potentially from templates).
    -   Updating task statuses.
    -   Adding notes to tasks.
    -   Retrieving task details.
2.  **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement a secure mechanism for external systems to authenticate. Consider:
    -   API Key-based authentication for simplicity.
    -   OAuth 2.0 for more complex integrations (future consideration).
3.  **Task Triggering**: Allow external systems to trigger specific tasks by their ID or by referencing predefined task templates.
4.  **Parameter Passing**: Design a clear and flexible way to pass task-related parameters (e.g., title, description, agent, priority, dependencies) through the API.
5.  **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and informative API responses.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New API endpoints are defined and documented.
- [ ] External systems can securely authenticate with the API.
- [ ] Tasks can be created and updated programmatically via the API.
- [ ] Task status can be changed via the API.
- [ ] API supports triggering tasks by ID and/or template.
- [ ] API responses are clear and provide useful error messages.
- [ ] Security best practices are followed (e.g., no hardcoded credentials).

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Design API Schema**: Define the request/response formats for each endpoint.
2.  **Choose Web Framework**: Select a lightweight Python web framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) if not already present, or extend existing CLI structure if feasible.
3.  **Implement Endpoints**: Write the Python code for each API endpoint, interacting with the `TaskManager`.
4.  **Implement Authentication**: Add API key validation or OAuth flow.
5.  **Testing**: Develop unit and integration tests for all API endpoints.
6.  **Documentation**: Create API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger spec, Markdown docs).

## Dependencies

-   `add-github-actions-cicd`: This API might be used by CI/CD workflows, so a robust CI/CD setup is beneficial.
