  to easily

  open the corresponding task Markdown files in their IDEs directly from the terminal.

## Task Description

Enhance the `list` and `show` commands in the CLI to transform task IDs into clickable links. When clicked in a modern terminal emulator, these links should open the associated Markdown task file in the user's configured IDE.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Task IDs displayed by `python -m src.task_management.cli list` are clickable links.
- [ ] Task IDs displayed by `python -m src.task_management.cli show <task_id>` are clickable links.
- [ ] Clicking a link opens the corresponding `.md` file in the user's default application for that file type (or ideally, their IDE).
- [ ] The base URL or scheme for generating links is configurable (e.g., via an environment variable or CLI option).
- [ ] The feature is robust across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) where terminal emulators support clickable links.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Identify CLI Output Points**: Locate where task IDs are printed in `src/task_management/cli.py` (e.g., `list_tasks`, `show_task`).
2.  **Determine Link Format**: Research common URL schemes for opening files in IDEs (e.g., `file:///path/to/file`, `vscode://file/path/to/file`).
3.  **Implement Link Generation Logic**: Create a helper function to construct the appropriate URL based on the task file path and a configurable base URL/scheme.
4.  **Apply Formatting**: Use terminal escape codes or a library (if available and appropriate) to make the generated URLs clickable in the terminal output.
5.  **Add Configuration Option**: Introduce a new CLI option or environment variable (e.g., `TASK_IDE_LINK_SCHEME`) to allow users to specify their preferred IDE link scheme.
6.  **Test**: Verify functionality on different platforms and with different IDE configurations.

## Notes

-   Consider using `click.style` or similar for terminal formatting if it simplifies the process.
-   The absolute path to the task file will be needed to construct the link.
