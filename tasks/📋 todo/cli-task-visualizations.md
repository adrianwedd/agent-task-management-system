title: Implement Simple CLI Visualizations for Tasks
description: 'Develop basic text-based visualizations within the CLI to represent
  tasks

  in different views (e.g., Kanban board, Gantt-like timeline, dependency graph).

  This will provide users with a quick, at-a-glance overview of their tasks

  without needing a full GUI.

## Task Description

Enhance the CLI with commands to display tasks in various visual formats, such as a Kanban-style board, a simplified Gantt chart, or a text-based dependency graph. These visualizations should be rendered directly in the terminal.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New CLI command `visualize` with subcommands for different views.
- [ ] `visualize kanban` displays tasks grouped by status in a Kanban-like format.
- [ ] `visualize gantt` displays a simplified timeline view of tasks (if due dates/estimated hours are present).
- [ ] `visualize dependencies` displays a text-based representation of task dependencies.
- [ ] Visualizations are clear, readable, and adapt to terminal width where possible.
- [ ] No external GUI libraries are required for these basic visualizations.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Design Text-Based Layouts**: Sketch out how each visualization will look using ASCII characters.
2.  **Implement Kanban View**: Group tasks by `status` and display them in columns.
3.  **Implement Simple Gantt View**: Calculate task durations and display them on a timeline using characters.
4.  **Implement Dependency Graph View**: Represent tasks and their dependencies using indentation or simple arrows.
5.  **Integrate with CLI**: Add a new `visualize` subcommand to `src/task_management/cli.py`.
6.  **Test**: Verify visualizations for correctness and readability with various task data.

## Notes

-   For Gantt, consider only tasks with `due_date` and `estimated_hours`.
-   For dependency graph, focus on direct dependencies initially.
-   The `rich` library could be explored for advanced terminal rendering, but start with basic `print` statements.
