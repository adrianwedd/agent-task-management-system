## Task Description

Implement a system for automated and semi-automated deduplication and merging of tasks within the task management system. This will help maintain a clean and efficient task database.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System can identify potential duplicate tasks based on configurable criteria.
- [ ] CLI command to list suggested duplicates.
- [ ] CLI command to perform automated merging of clear duplicates.
- [ ] CLI command to facilitate manual merging, allowing user input for conflict resolution.
- [ ] Merged tasks correctly transfer all relevant data (notes, dependencies, history).
- [ ] No data loss occurs during deduplication or merging.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Define Duplication Criteria**: Establish rules for what constitutes a duplicate task.
2.  **Develop Detection Logic**: Implement algorithms to find potential duplicates.
3.  **Implement Automated Merging**: Create logic for merging tasks where conflicts are minimal or resolvable automatically.
4.  **Implement Manual Merging CLI**: Develop interactive CLI commands for user-guided merging.
5.  **Update TaskManager**: Integrate new functions into `TaskManager`.
6.  **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all merging scenarios.

## Dependencies

-   None directly, but a stable `TaskManager` is essential.
