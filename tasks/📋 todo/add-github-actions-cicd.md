## Task Description

Create a professional GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that automatically validates code quality, runs tests, and performs security checks on every commit and pull request.

## Workflow Components

### Main CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- [ ] Multi-Python version testing (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- [ ] Automated dependency installation
- [ ] Comprehensive test execution
- [ ] Code coverage reporting
- [ ] Test results artifacts

### Code Quality Pipeline (`.github/workflows/quality.yml`)
- [ ] Linting with flake8/ruff
- [ ] Type checking with mypy
- [ ] Code formatting with black
- [ ] Import sorting with isort
- [ ] Complexity analysis with radon

### Security Pipeline (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning (safety/bandit)
- [ ] Secret detection
- [ ] SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- [ ] License compliance checking

### Documentation Pipeline (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)
- [ ] Documentation building
- [ ] Link checking
- [ ] API documentation generation
- [ ] README validation

## Quality Gates

- [ ] All tests must pass
- [ ] Code coverage >90%
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] All linting checks pass
- [ ] Type checking passes

## Status Badges

Add to README.md:
- [ ] CI Status
- [ ] Coverage Percentage
- [ ] Code Quality Score
- [ ] Security Status
- [ ] License Badge

## Advanced Features

- [ ] Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Deployment automation (if applicable)
- [ ] Release automation with semantic versioning
