## Task Description

Create a professional Python packaging setup that makes the agent task management system easily installable and distributable. This demonstrates understanding of Python ecosystem best practices and package management.

## Packaging Components

### Modern Python Packaging (pyproject.toml)
- [ ] Complete project metadata
- [ ] Dependency specifications
- [ ] Entry points for CLI commands
- [ ] Development dependencies
- [ ] Build system configuration

### Version Management
- [ ] Semantic versioning strategy
- [ ] Automated version bumping
- [ ] Changelog generation
- [ ] Git tag integration
- [ ] Release notes automation

### Distribution Configuration
- [ ] PyPI-ready configuration
- [ ] Wheel and source distribution setup
- [ ] Long description from README
- [ ] Classifiers and keywords
- [ ] License and author information

### Installation Options
- [ ] pip installation support
- [ ] Development installation mode
- [ ] Optional dependencies for extras
- [ ] Platform-specific considerations
