title: Add Due Dates to Critical Priority Tasks
description: |
  Identify all tasks with 'critical' priority that currently lack a due date
  and assign a reasonable due date to them. This is crucial for proper task
  management and to resolve validation warnings.

  The due dates should be realistic and reflect the urgency of critical tasks.
  Consider a short timeframe (e.g., 1-3 days from today) for these dates.

## Task Description

This task involves reviewing all tasks marked with 'critical' priority and ensuring that each of them has a `due_date` assigned. This will help in better tracking and management of high-priority items and resolve related validation warnings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All tasks with `priority: critical` have a `due_date` set.
- [ ] The validation warning "Critical priority tasks should have a due date" is no longer present in the validation report.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **List Critical Tasks**: Use the CLI to list all tasks with `priority: critical`.
2.  **Identify Missing Due Dates**: Filter this list for tasks where `due_date` is `null` or missing.
3.  **Assign Due Dates**: For each identified task, use the CLI's `update` command (once implemented) or manually edit the Markdown file to add a realistic `due_date`.
4.  **Validate**: Run `python -m src.task_management.cli validate` to confirm the warnings are resolved.
