title: Research Brilliant and Available Names for the Task Management System
description: Conduct comprehensive research to identify a compelling, memorable, and
  available name for the task management system. Consider CLI usage patterns (e.g.,
  '{appname} create task'), domain availability, npm package availability, and trademark
  concerns. The name should reflect the system's collaborative, intelligent, and efficient
  nature while being easy to type and remember for daily CLI usage.
