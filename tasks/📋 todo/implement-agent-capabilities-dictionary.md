title: Implement Configurable Agent Capabilities Dictionary
description: |
  Develop a configurable dictionary or mapping of agent capabilities to keywords
  or task types. This will allow the validation system to more accurately assess
  if a task's content matches the assigned agent's capabilities, reducing
  'agent: Task content may not match agent capabilities' info messages.

## Task Description

Implement a mechanism to define and manage agent capabilities through a configurable dictionary. This dictionary will map agent names to a set of keywords or descriptions that represent their expertise. The task validation system will then use this mapping to provide more intelligent feedback on agent assignments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new configuration file (e.g., `config/agent_capabilities.yaml`) is introduced to define agent capabilities.
- [ ] The `TaskValidator` loads and utilizes this configuration.
- [ ] The 'agent: Task content may not match agent capabilities' info messages are significantly reduced or eliminated for correctly assigned tasks.
- [ ] The system can suggest more appropriate agents based on task content and the capabilities dictionary.
- [ ] The capabilities dictionary is easily extensible and modifiable by users.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Create `config/agent_capabilities.yaml`**: Define a structure for mapping agents to capabilities (e.g., a list of keywords).
2.  **Modify `TaskValidator`**: Update `_load_valid_agents` or create a new method to load the `agent_capabilities.yaml` file.
3.  **Update `_validate_agent_assignment`**: Refine the logic in `TaskValidator` to use the new capabilities dictionary for more accurate matching.
4.  **Integrate with `TaskTemplates`**: Potentially use this dictionary to suggest agents when creating tasks from templates.
5.  **Test**: Verify that agent assignment validation is more accurate and that the info messages are reduced.

## Dependencies

-   `standardize-agent-naming-strategy`: Ensures a consistent set of agent names to map capabilities to.
