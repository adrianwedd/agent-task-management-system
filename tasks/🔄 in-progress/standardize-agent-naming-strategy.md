## Description

Clean up agent naming inconsistencies from other repositories and establish a standardized, 
generic agent naming strategy suitable for portfolio demonstration. Remove specific agent 
names that are project-specific and create a clean, professional agent taxonomy.


## Notes

Current agent names are too specific to other projects. Need generic, professional names
that demonstrate the system without revealing proprietary information.
