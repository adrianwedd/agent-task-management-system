notes: '[2025-07-24T10:03:17.838741] Still debugging test failures. `TypeError: object of type \'Task\'' has no len()` in `test_list_tasks_cli` and `AssertionError` in `test_create_task_cli` related to `NoneType` iterables. The `Task.__post_init__` was modified to initialize `dependencies` and `tags` to empty lists if they are `None`. The CLI was refactored to use `click` and `Dict` import was added. The `pytest.ini` was added to resolve `ModuleNotFoundError` for `src` imports. The `os` module was imported in `test_task_manager.py`. The `_validate_agent_workload` method in `TaskValidator` was updated to directly access `self.task_manager.tasks_cache`.'
