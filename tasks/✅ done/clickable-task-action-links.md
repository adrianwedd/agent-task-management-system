## Description

Enhance the CLI's task listing to include clickable links that, when activated,
execute predefined actions for each task (e.g., 'start', 'complete', 'add note').
This will streamline task management directly from the terminal output.


## Notes

This feature should consider how to represent different actions (e.g., icons, short text)
and how to generate the corresponding shell commands for execution. It might leverage
terminal capabilities for clickable text.
