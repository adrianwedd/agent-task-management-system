## Description

Address the recurring 'created_at: Created date cannot be in the future' errors
and timezone comparison issues. This involves ensuring that `created_at` and
`updated_at` timestamps are consistently timezone-aware upon task creation and
that validation logic correctly handles timezone-aware datetimes.


## Notes

The issue seems to stem from a mismatch between timezone-naive timestamps being
set during task creation/loading and timezone-aware comparisons in the validator.
All timestamps should be consistently timezone-aware (UTC).
