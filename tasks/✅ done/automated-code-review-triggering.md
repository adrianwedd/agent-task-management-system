## Description

Develop a system to automatically trigger code reviews by agents (e.g., Claude)
based on predefined events (e.g., pull request creation, specific labels).
This will leverage the task management system's API to create review tasks
and assign them to appropriate agents.


## Notes

This task will involve setting up GitHub webhooks or similar mechanisms to listen
for events, and then using the task management API to create and manage review tasks.
Consider how to pass relevant context (PR URL, commit SHA) to the review agent.
