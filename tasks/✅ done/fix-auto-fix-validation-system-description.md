## Description

The description of 'implement-auto-fix-validation-system.md' contains malformed YAML
due to unescaped log output, causing parsing errors. This task involves cleaning
the description to restore valid YAML and ensure the task can be loaded correctly.


## Notes

The problematic content appears to be raw CLI output that was incorrectly inserted
into the YAML description. It needs to be removed or properly escaped.
