title: Implement Text Deconstruction System for Task Generation
description: Create a comprehensive system to deconstruct long-form text documents
  (project specifications, academic research papers, technical documentation, requirements
  documents) into many discrete, actionable tasks. Initially this will be a human-agent
  collaborative process with defined workflows, but the system should be designed
  to eventually automate this task breakdown process.
