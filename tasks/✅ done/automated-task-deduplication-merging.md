  merging for high-confidence duplicates (95%+ similarity), 4) Manual merge with conflict

## Description

Develop functionality to automatically identify and merge duplicate tasks,
and to provide tools for manual merging of related tasks. This will improve
data hygiene and reduce redundancy in the task management system.


## Notes

Consider different criteria for identifying duplicates (e.g., title similarity,
description similarity, agent/priority/dependency combinations). Manual merging
should allow users to select which fields to retain from each task.
