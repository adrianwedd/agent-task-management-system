title: Integrate Claude Codebase Action for Automated Code Analysis
description: 'Integrate the Claude Codebase Action (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-base-action)

  to allow Claude to perform automated code analysis and, crucially, to trigger and
  manage

  tasks within *this* task management system via its new API. This integration will
  be

  scoped to avoid running on every code change to prevent exceeding API limits.

  It should also support human-triggered analysis via @mentions in PRs, GitHub issues,

  or other designated interfaces.

## Notes

This integration will provide valuable automated feedback on code quality and potential issues,
leveraging Claude's capabilities. It depends on the existing task to set up GitHub Actions CI/CD.
