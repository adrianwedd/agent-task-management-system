title: Implement API for External Task Triggering
description: 'Implement a robust API for the task management system to allow external
  applications

  (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, other agents) to programmatically trigger and manage tasks.

  This includes defining API endpoints, implementing secure authentication/authorization

  (e.g., API keys, OAuth), enabling task creation/updates by ID or template, and handling

  parameter passing for task details.

## Description

Implement a robust API for the task management system to allow external applications
(e.g., CI/CD pipelines, other agents) to programmatically trigger and manage tasks.
This includes defining API endpoints, implementing secure authentication/authorization
(e.g., API keys, OAuth), enabling task creation/updates by ID or template, and handling
parameter passing for task details.


## Notes

This API will be crucial for integrating the task management system with broader
automation workflows and enabling more dynamic agent interactions. Security and
robustness are key considerations.
