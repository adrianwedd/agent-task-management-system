## Description

Implement comprehensive persistent logging to disk with log rotation, multiple log levels,
structured logging, and configurable output formats. Critical for production deployment,
debugging, audit trails, and demonstrating enterprise-grade system administration skills.


## Notes

Current logging only goes to console. Need persistent disk logging for:
- Production debugging and troubleshooting
- Audit trails for task operations  
- Performance monitoring and analysis
- System health tracking
- Compliance and security requirements


[2025-07-24T07:38:37.248854] Status changed from complete to blocked_by: Automatically set to BLOCKED_BY as it is blocking other tasks.
