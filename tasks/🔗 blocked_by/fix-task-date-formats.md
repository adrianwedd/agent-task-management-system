## Description

Fix the date format issues in all recently created portfolio enhancement task files. 
The system expects ISO datetime strings with quotes and microseconds, but the created 
tasks use unquoted datetime formats causing parsing errors.


## Notes

Current parsing errors: "fromisoformat: argument must be str"

Need to update all task files in /tasks/todo/ to use proper format:
- created_at: '2025-07-24T01:15:00.000000+00:00' (with quotes and microseconds)
- updated_at: '2025-07-24T01:15:00.000000+00:00' (with quotes and microseconds)

Files to fix:
- create-demo-examples.md
- create-comprehensive-test-suite.md  
- add-code-quality-tools.md
- enhance-documentation.md
- create-integration-examples.md
- enhance-cli-user-experience.md
- add-performance-optimization.md
- add-packaging-distribution.md
- add-github-actions-cicd.md


[2025-07-24T07:38:37.253056] Status changed from complete to blocked_by: Automatically set to BLOCKED_BY as it is blocking other tasks.
